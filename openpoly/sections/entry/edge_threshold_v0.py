"""Edge-threshold entry — the entry decision section.

Picks a side from the analyzer's ``p_model`` (YES when ``p_model >= 0.5``, else
NO), reads the held side's live order book, and gates on edge + spread::

    held_price = best ask of the held side's token
    spread     = best ask - best bid
    edge       = (p_model if YES else 1 - p_model) - held_price

A position is sized by ``order_size_usd`` at ``held_price``, optionally scaled
by how far the edge exceeds ``min_edge`` (``size_edge_multiplier_max``, off by
default — see that field). The section emits a decision only — an
``OrderIntent``; the executor turns it into an actual fill and is authoritative
on the realized price. The book is read level-1 only (best ask / best bid),
matching the executor's crude micro-stakes fill model.

The intent also carries the belief behind it (``p_model`` / ``confidence`` /
``edge``) so the executor can freeze it onto the position row; that is what
``GET /api/analytics/calibration`` later reads, and it is the evidence that has
to exist before edge-scaled sizing is turned on.

The section reads the live ``MarketStore`` singleton directly (same pattern as
the embedding section — no capability injection). When configured with a
``portfolio_provider``, it also reads the portfolio to enforce
``same_market_cooldown_minutes`` — a per-(market, side) re-entry cooldown that
prevents the "SL → news → re-enter NO → SL again" pattern seen in early paper
runs. The hard one-position-per-(market, side) invariant is still enforced by
the executor + the DB partial unique index; the cooldown is the *soft* gate
that also catches recently-closed positions.

When ``veto_enabled``, ``run()`` also does a late-buy veto — a CLOB
``/prices-history`` fetch — so the orchestrator offloads it to a worker thread.

        the caller can surface it as a signal rather than leaving an unexplained
        base-size order.

        The multiplier is ``clamp(edge / min_edge, 1.0, size_edge_multiplier_max)``
        and never shrinks an order: at the default cap of 1.0 this returns
        exactly ``order_size_usd``, so sizing is unchanged from before the knob
        existed. ``min_edge == 0`` makes the ratio meaningless (and undefined),
        so scaling is off there too.

        ``heat_cap_usd`` then bounds the *scaled* notional: the extra size the
        multiplier grants is trimmed to the headroom left over currently-open
        exposure. It is deliberately never trimmed below ``order_size_usd`` —
        the cap's existing job is to gate on exposure already taken (that
        pre-check is unchanged), not to shrink the base order — so a config
        with the knob at its 1.0 default behaves exactly as it did.

        When the cap is on but ``open_cost`` is unknown (no portfolio to read),
        the multiplier is refused outright rather than applied unbounded. The
        cap is the only thing standing between a 3x multiplier and 3x the
        intended exposure, and "the portfolio was unreadable" is exactly the
