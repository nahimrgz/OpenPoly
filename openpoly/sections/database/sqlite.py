"""SQLite database section.

Thin section-protocol wrapper over the persistence runtime. The engine and the
two write-behind writers live in ``DatabaseManager`` (see ``openpoly.db.manager``);
this class exists so ``database`` registers in the section catalog — giving it a
canvas node and an inspector — and so ``run()`` can hand back a status snapshot.

Lifecycle (start / stop) is driven by the FastAPI lifespan against the manager
singleton, not this class.
