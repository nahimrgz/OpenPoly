"""Database foundation — SQLAlchemy engine, session factory, schema bootstrap.

openPoly persists to a single SQLite file. The system is single-process (see
``docs/architecture/01-isolation.md``), so SQLite needs no server. A few writer
contexts still coexist — the executor on the event loop, the write-behind
writers on worker threads — so SQLite engines run WAL journal mode + a busy
timeout (see ``make_engine``) to make a writer queue rather than fail.
``OPENPOLY_DB_URL`` overrides the path — tests point it at a throwaway file.
SQLAlchemy keeps the code dialect-agnostic.
