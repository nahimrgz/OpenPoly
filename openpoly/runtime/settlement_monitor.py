"""Settlement monitor — closes resolved-market positions at 0/1 final price.

Slice E. When a Polymarket market resolves, ``outcomePrices`` is stamped on
the Gamma market record. The exit-monitor doesn't catch this because the
resolved market typically drops out of the discovery catalog (Gamma's
``/events`` is filtered to ``closed=false``), so any open position on it
gets stuck at ``status=open``.

This monitor sweeps periodically (default every 5 min — settlement is slow,
no need to poll fast), groups open positions by ``condition_id``, fetches
those specific markets via the dedicated ``fetch_markets_by_condition_id``
path (which does NOT pass ``closed=false``), and for any resolved one calls
``PortfolioStore.close_position(reason="settlement", sell_price=0_or_1)``
directly — no broker tx, no CLOB call, no on-chain redemption.

CTF redemption (winning tokens → pUSD on the DepositWallet) is a separate
on-chain action that is **out of slice E scope** — slice C V2 pivot
corrigendum §C.SliceE.
