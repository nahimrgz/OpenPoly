"""Reconciliation monitor — closes DB-open positions the wallet no longer holds.

The exit monitor and settlement monitor both assume the DB position ledger
matches on-chain reality. It can diverge: a position is exited on-chain (sold,
redeemed, transferred) without openPoly recording the close — e.g. the on-chain
SELL filled but the DB write was dropped (pre-hardening), or a manual/external
trade. The position then sits ``status=open`` forever: the exit monitor fires
into a void (``ctf_cache_not_synced`` loop) and the UI shows fictional exposure.

The settlement monitor can't catch this — it only closes positions whose
*market* resolved (Gamma ``closed=true``); a position emptied on-chain while its
market is still active is invisible to it.

This monitor sweeps periodically, asks an injected ``holdings_fetcher`` what the
wallet actually holds on-chain (the production fetcher hits the Polymarket
data-api, which is authoritative and accounts for neg-risk wrapping), and for
any open position whose ``(condition_id, side)`` is absent from that set —
*and* older than ``grace_seconds`` (a fresh buy's settlement/indexer update can
lag) — closes it via ``close_position(reason="reconciled")``.

Realized PnL is deliberately recorded as **0** (close at ``avg_entry_price``):
the real exit price lives on-chain but can't be reliably attributed back to a
specific openPoly position when the same market was traded more than once, so we
do not fabricate a number. The reconciled close stops the bleed; PnL truth is a
separate, manual concern.

Reuses ``settlement_log`` for observability (same close-to-match-reality shape);
``reason="reconciled"`` distinguishes its entries.
