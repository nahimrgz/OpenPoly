"""Portfolio domain types.

These dataclasses are what ``PortfolioStore`` hands back; the ORM tables in
``openpoly.db.tables`` (``FillRow`` / ``PositionRow``) are the persisted form.

``HeldPosition`` is the open-position view used by the executor and (next
phase) the exit section — it deliberately omits ``current_price``: that is a
runtime injection the exit decision receives, not a stored field.
``PositionRecord`` is the full projection (open + closed) for the read API.
